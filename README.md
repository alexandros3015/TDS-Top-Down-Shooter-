# TDS-Top-Down-Shooter

3. Press play

## Gameplay loop
The gameplay loop is as follows:
- The player controls a "scope" that follows the mouse
- The player can shoot with the mouse to kill enemies
- Enemies spawn in from the left and move towards the right
- If the enemies make it to the right, the base takes damage
- The player's goal is to kill the enemies before they reach the base
- The player can kill enemies for money, which is used to buy upgrades
- The upgrades include damage, cooldown, and radius of scope
- The more enemies killed, the more money you get per kill
- The more enemies killed, the less time in between enemy spawns
